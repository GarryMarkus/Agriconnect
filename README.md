# Agriconnect
AgriConnect is an innova􀆟ve pla􀆞orm designed to bridge the gap between agricultural workers, land providers, and buyers in the agricultural sector. Our pla􀆞orm aims to create a sustainable ecosystem that not only facilitates agricultural prac􀆟ces but also educates individuals about farming and crop management.
